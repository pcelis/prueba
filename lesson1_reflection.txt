How diff helps in finding bugs?
Diff two files help to pinpoint possible bugs
Diff shows lines that changed, the bug must be there
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You could change files without any fear of breaking it.
Sometimes you change too much and can't take it back. Versions would be helpful in such cases.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Choosing manually is prompt to be forgotten by the programmer
however, changes would be more meaningful
It is good to commit once per logical change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files 
in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Files in a project are related. 
Fixing a bug might need changes in several files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log givees commit ids and messages
Git diff needs two commits and show their differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I am more likely to change things with the assurance that I can revert to a previous
working state
